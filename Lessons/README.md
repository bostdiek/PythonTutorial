# Lesson overview
## Lesson 1: General python
In addition to general syntax, we will also look at:
  * Data types
  * Control statements
  * Functions
  * Classes
  * Importing
  * File I/O

Here is another [good tutorial](https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/) covering python basics

## Lesson 2: NumPy/pandas
This lesson looks at loading in a physics data set. Using numpy and pandas, we
calculate the invariant mass of given four vectors and plot the distributions.
  * My solutions are shown in the PythonPractieRound2.ipynb file, although there
  is more than one way to get the desired solutions.

## Just python
  * This need an installation of ROOT which knows about Python
  
It is not necessary to use jupyter notebooks, even though they are useful. For
instance, when running on a cluster, it may not be feasible. You can still accomplish
the same things.
